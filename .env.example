# API Base URL Configuration for Production
# 
# Instructions:
# 1. Rename this file to '.env' (without the .txt extension if applicable) on your server.
# 2. Set the VITE_API_URL below.
#
# SCENARIO A: Your Node backend is on the SAME domain as the frontend (e.g., both on waydacode.com)
# AND you have set up a proxy to route /api requests to your Node app port.
# Keep this empty or comment it out to use relative paths (recommended).
# VITE_API_URL=

# SCENARIO B: Your Node backend is on a DIFFERENT domain or subdomain (e.g., api.waydacode.com)
# Set the full URL here (no trailing slash).
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.waydacode.com

# SCENARIO C: You are running Node on a known port on the same server but without proxy (Not recommended for prod)
# VITE_API_URL=http://your-server-ip:5000
